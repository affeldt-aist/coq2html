 * `process_glob_file`
A glob file is a text file that contains reference information for the location information of tokens when the v-file is divided into tokens.
This process creates a table for each glob file that can look up the reference information using the location information as a key.

 * `process_v_file`
Generates html files while parsing v files.
The above-mentioned reference information table is also used to generate the html file so that the user can click on lemmas or function names to jump to the referenced destination.

 * `Generate_index.generate`

Create an index page like the one in coqdoc for each module from the reference table.
